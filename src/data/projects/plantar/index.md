My partner, [Patrick Zimmerman](//solitairyhands.com), and I are nerds, and we spent a weekend doing a mini-VR hackathon. We decided to make a small AR application where we could grow plants (as we ended up killing our real ones too many times). I helped develop this while Patrick worked on the 3D modeling and animation.

Technologies used included: Unity, the iOS SDK for Unity, Vuforia for image recognition, and Cinema 4D for the model and animation.

Check out [this blog post](https://neuroticrefactoring.wordpress.com/2017/04/01/plant-ar-experiment-for-ios/) for more detail.
