description: "An animation adaptation based on the epynomous short story."
description_long: "In college, I double-majored in Film and Math, and it was there that I dove into animation. In a sense, this was my 'thesis' film project, which I based off a short story of the same name by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.  I rotoscoped this short animation in Flash, composited it in After Effects, and used archival footage of advertisements to texture the sound design.
