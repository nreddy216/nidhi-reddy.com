Most recently, I was a <b>Technical Lead</b> at <a href='//leftfieldlabs.com'>Left Field Labs</a>, where I led a small team dedicated to a variety of Google's developer-focused websites and applications.
<br><br>
Clients I've worked with include:
<a href='//google.com'>Google</a>, <a href='//audiusa.com'>Audi, <a href='//firebase.com'>Firebase</a>, <a href='//tensorflow.org'>TensorFlow</a>, <a href='//fastlane.tools'>Fastlane</a>, and more.
<br><br>
Outside of coding, I <a href='//instagram.com/nidhisreddy'>make art</a>, write, yell about politics, play board games, and have most recently gotten obsessed with cats (not the musical).
<br><br>
If you'd like to work with me or just say hi, email me at <a href='mailto:me@nidhi-reddy.com'>me@nidhi-reddy.com</a>."
