			<p> (it's pronounced ni-THEE)<p>

			<p>I am passionate design, technology, and education.</p>

			<p>I currently work at Khan Academy as a Math Pioneer Fellow, doing anything I can to further our mission of providing a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere. </p>
			<!-- <p>Not only do I venture into new territories and discover where to cultivate math plants, along with my amazing team, I do anything possible to help further our mission of providing education for anyone, anywhere.</p> -->
			<p>Before that, I double-majored in Mathematics & Film at the University of Texas at Austin. At the same time, I earned certificates in Digital Arts & Media and the Elements of Computing.</p>
