		<h1>Hi, I'm Nidhi</h1>
		<p>I currently work at Khan Academy as a Math Pioneer Fellow.</p>
		<p>I do anything possible to help further our mission of providing education for anyone, anywhere.</p>
		<p>Before that, I double-majored in Mathematics & Film at the University of Texas at Austin. Simultaneously, I earned certificates in Digital Arts & Media and the Elements of Computing.</p>

		<p>It was during this time that I realized my passion for the intersection of art, technology, and learning. </p>
