I worked with [Estella Tse](//estellatse.com), an XR artist, and [Katie Hughes](//hughezilla.com), an XR user experience designer, to build this pet dog for the Microsoft Hololens during a 3-day VR hackathon. Our dog, Buster, knew a few voice commands, like <em>speak</em>, <em>sit</em>, and a very comical<em>play dead</em>. I was a developer for this project and used Unity with a Hololens SDK, while Estella helped with developing for the dog interactions and project managing, and Katie mapped out the user experience and vision.

For more information about this project, check out [this blog post](https://neuroticrefactoring.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/introducing-holodog/).

During this hackathon, we won a prize for Best Social VR based on the vision we had for this product beyond this initial demo.
