## Overview

For this site, the main challenge was the animations. We weren't necessarily provided a mock for the motion of the hero banner (with flying dots and triangles), so as an amateur animator, I was happy to take on the task of figuring out its motion design. I also prototyped this banner in a variety of technologies, from WebGL to GSAP to AfterEffects, since this was honestly just a fun task to do.

One test that I liked but ultimately wasn't the right feel for the flat design of the site was with WebGL, where the circle particles were lights that illuminated the triangles.
