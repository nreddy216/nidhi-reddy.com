Most recently, I was a <b>Technical Lead</b> at <a href='//leftfieldlabs.com'>Left Field Labs</a>, where I led a small team dedicated to Google's developer-focused websites and applications.
<br><br>
Clients I've worked with include:

Outside of code, I <a href='//instagram.com/nidhisreddy'>make art</a>, write, yell about politics, play board games, and have most recently gotten obsessed with cats (not the musical).

Feel free to say hi at me@nidhi-reddy.com.  I'm especially interested in working with organizations who are helping solve real-world problems, so please reach out."
